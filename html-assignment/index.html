        <h3 style= "text-align: center;">About me</h3>
            <p style= "text-align: center;">Hi, my name is Kim Wapachee-McDougall. <i>But, you probably already know that from the header. </i> I have recently graduated from the <abbr title="Television Broadcasting Program">TVB</abbr> and I’m currently in the interactive media design program. I’m originally from Mistissini, which is located in northern Quebec. I moved to Ottawa in August 18<sup>th</sup> 2018 and I’m really enjoying it. I miss home; however, I feel I can get more being here.
            </p>
            <p style= "text-align: center;">When I studied broadcasting television, I strived to create stories for and by Indigenous people and I’m still currently moving towards doing that.<strong> I’ve pitched a show to amazon and plan on pitching many more in the future.</strong> I’ve always found joy in creating content and characters that I wish I had growing up, and I feel that as of recently there’s been more coming out of the wood works. It makes me feel very proud. I am excited to learn more about media design moving forward because I feel it will aid in fleshing out ideas and being able to create tangible works of art in showing what I’d like to create. And no, my show was not picked up. <em>Yet.</em>
